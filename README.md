# SCT_SD_2
A simple C++ console-based number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user keeps guessing until they get the right number, with feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" after each guess. Perfect for beginners to practice loops, conditionals, rand(), and srand(time(0)).
